            <h2>Chapter 1: The Dawn of Enlightenment</h2>
            <p>The Age of Enlightenment, also known as the Age of Reason, was a pivotal period in European history that spanned the 17th and 18th centuries. It was characterized by a surge in intellectual exploration, scientific discoveries, and philosophical debates that challenged traditional authority and dogma.</p>
            <p>The Enlightenment thinkers believed in the power of human reason to understand the world and improve society. They promoted ideas such as liberty, progress, tolerance, fraternity, constitutional government, and separation of church and state.</p>
            <div class="quote">"Common sense and reason both arise from the same root." â€” Thomas Reid</div>
            <p>This era questioned long-held beliefs and sought to understand the world through observation and rational thought, laying the groundwork for modern philosophy and political thought.</p>
